# Instantly Load/Open Photoshop

![Example](https://github.com/asheroto/Faster-Photoshop/blob/master/Demo.gif?raw=true)

In today's gotta-have-it-fast world, waiting 5-10 seconds for Photoshop to load is so '90s. ðŸ¤£

Maybe it's no big deal, but hey, if we *could* make Photoshop load **instantly**, why not?

Hence the idea for **Faster-Photoshop**!

No need to wait on Photoshop to load any longer!

- **Faster-Photoshop** makes Photoshop open **instantly** when you press `Ctrl+Win+Shift+P`
- With Photoshop open, when you press the `Alt+F4` Photoshop is **instantly** closed
- Pressing `Ctrl+Win+Shift+P` again makes Photoshop open **instantly**

## How it works

#### Startup
- At log on, **Faster-Photoshop** launches `Photoshop.exe` in the background
- It waits a second and then hides the main window
- It suspends the processes `Photoshop.exe` and `dynamiclinkmanager.exe` which ensures no resources are in use

#### To Open Photoshop
- Press `Ctrl+Win+Shift+P`

#### To Close Photoshop
- While in Photoshop, press `Alt+F4`

#### To Actually End the Photoshop Processes
- While in Photoshop, go to File > Exit
